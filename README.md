# Web app for controlling robot over XBee via iPad

Works with [this sketch](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/arduino/tree/master/iPadControlledIRAvoidingNoEvents) and is similar to the system shown [here](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2010/10/wanderer-v2-with-wireless-wii-nunchuck/) except that it uses an iPad (communicating with this web app which relays messages via Xbee) instead of a WiiChuck as the controller.
